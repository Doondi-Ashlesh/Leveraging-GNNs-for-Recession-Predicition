INSTRUCTIONS:
--------------
-> The GNN_pipeline.ipynb is the source code, includes the whole methodology (dataset preparation, Preprocessing, model definitions, model initializations, Training and testing, plotting metrics and final deploying the saved model using Gradio interface on localhost).

-> If you don't want to train the models from start and then see the results, the interface folder already has a quick implementation (from our experiments) with required saved files in it. 

-> Go to Interface folder -> open Interface.py in a python environment -> make sure the dependencies and necessary libraries are all available (as listed in comments and also included in imports and libraries) -> Run the code -> open localhost on a browser -> input comma separated values (provided in sample_inputs_for_interface text file in the interface folder) -> click on autofill -> scroll down to predict button -> click on predict -> get prediction outputs.

->The dataset used for the experimentation is also included in the dataset folder( this is a custom dataset created from Economic Features of US Recession - Kaggle dataset)

-> Make sure to change the dataset path and name in case of a miss match.

NOTE: A video demo of how the interface works is also included. (No audio )
